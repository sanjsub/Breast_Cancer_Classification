# Breast_Cancer_Classification
Developed random forest and deep learning models to assess whether traditional machine learning models trained on extracted features from convolutional neural network (CNN) models could outperform these CNNs when trained on Digital Breast Tomosynethesis (DBT) images, a type of 3-dimensional scan which has been shown to outperform traditional 2D mammography, although at a more expensive clip.

The Project Code folder includes preprocessing files for DBT images and train/test splits in addition to specific experimental files:
- Model_jpg
- Model_tiff
- pretrained_model_final
- rf_model

The data folder contains a full train/val/test split along with a condensed version
